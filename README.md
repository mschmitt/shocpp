# shocpp

A rudimentary implementation of OCPP, the Open Charge Point Protocol, Version 1.6

## Status

Experimental: Still switching off OCPP to fall back to the charger's internal RFID accounting when I'm done testing.

## Goal

Build a customizable private OCPP service that can safely ignore the public-infrastructure aspects of most other implementations.

## Scope

- Allow charging initiated by (RF)ID tag presentation (Active *Authorize/StartTransaction* calls from the charger).
- Allow charging initiated by the service (*RemoteStartTransaction* call to the charger with an (RF)ID tag to be assumed as presented).
- Keep track of power consumption on a per-account basis. (RF)ID tags are assigned to accounts.

## Limitations

- No authentication of charger, but can be added on a reverse proxy level.
- No encryption, but can be added on a reverse proxy level.
- Known obstacles to operation with more than one charger:
  - *shocpp-command* has no facility to route a command to a specific charger/shocpp process.


## Architecture

- *shocpp-backend* implements the entire logic and communicates via stdin/stdout, as known from inetd/xinetd/cgi-bin.
- *shocpp-listener* wraps *shocpp-backend* behind *websocketd*.
- *shocpp-command* passes payloads to *shocpp-backend*, to be sent to the charger.

## Configuration

- Listen address via the *WS_ADDRESS* environment (default: *0.0.0.0*, listen on all interfaces).
- Listen port via the *WS_PORT* environment (default: *8080*).
- Path to *tags.json* via *SHOCPP_TAGSFILE* environment (default: *conf/tags.json,* parallel to shocpp's *bin/* directory)
- Path to Accounting directory via *SHOCPP_ACCOUNTINGDIR* environment (default: *accounting/*, parallel to shocpp's *bin/* directory)

## tags.json

*tags.json* is a list of accounts, to which ID tags for the charger are assigned.

```json
[
  {
    "index": 1,
    "account": "company-x",
    "ids": [
      "1111",
      "2222"
    ]
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "account": "family-y",
    "ids": [
      "3333",
      "4444"
    ]
  },
  {
    "index": 3,
    "account": "company-z",
    "ids": [
      "5555",
      "6666",
      "7777",
      "8888",
      "9999"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Transaction ID model

*shocpp* keeps no state, but offloads state into the Transaction ID:

- *Rumor has it* that transaction IDs are signed Int32, so max transaction ID is *2.147.483.647*.
- The account ID from *tags.json* for a given (RF)ID tag is multiplied x 10000000. The Wh meter reading at start is converted to kWh and added to it. This number is the Transaction ID.
- On end of transaction, the transaction ID transmitted by the charger is disassembled back into account ID and meter reading at start, based on which the consumption is calculated.
- By this calculation, 
  - shocpp can serve up to 214 accounts, and infiniteâ„¢ (RF)ID tags, and
  - at a meter reading of 10 GWh, the world comes to an end.


## *shocpp-command* examples

Synopsis:

```shell
shocpp-command <Call> <JSON Payload (the "inner" JSON) for call>
```

Examples:

```shell
bin/shocpp-command "RemoteStartTransaction" '{"idTag":"00000000"}'
bin/shocpp-command "Reset" '{"type":"Soft"}'`
bin/shocpp-command "Reset" '{"type":"Hard"}'`
```

## HOWTO sniff OCPP traffic

Sourced from: https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/questions/60725/how-to-dump-websockets-live-with-tshark/

```shell
tshark -p -i any -s0 -f 'port 8080' -Y websocket.payload -E occurrence=l -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e text
```

## TODO

- Systemd unit, generalize runtime environment.
- error/exit/cleanup behaviour is not quite right. (set -o errexit seems wrong, better ignore some errors and keep going, Ctrl+C, something something)

## Future TODOs

- Implement more functionality:
  - Power level and phase switching, solar integration.
- Command routing in *shocpp-command*:
  - Add identification of charger (serial number) to *shocpp-command* invocation, signal all processes, have the command sent by the process that is in contact with the given charger. Note that the serial is never actively transmitted after *BootNotification* and will have to be kept as state.

## OCPP observations on go-eCharger Gemini

- OCPP compliance
  - *TriggerMessage* call for *MeterValues* supported since FW 055.7 Beta.

- Locally known RFID tags
  - 055.5: Sends locally known RFID tags to OCPP for authorization. Once authorized, consumption is reported to OCPP (*StartTransaction/StopTransaction*) and also added to the local RFID slot. The consumption after *RemoteStartTransaction* for the same RFID tag's ID is also added to the RFID slot.
  - 055.7 BETA: Accepts locally known RFID tags without any OCPP interaction, but adds consumption to the next free (unassigned) RFID configuration slot.

- Reconnect and reboot behaviour
  - If the charger reconnects after loss of the websocket connection, it checks back in with a *BootNotification*.
  - If the charger ends a transaction while the websocket connection is not available, it submits *StopTransaction* after reconnecting.
  - If the charger ends a transaction and reboots while the websocket connection is not available, and the websocket only becomes available after complete reboot, it submits *StopTransaction* after reconnecting.
  - More test cases? Seems solid so far.
